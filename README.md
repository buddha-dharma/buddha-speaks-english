# The Buddha Speaks English
(1) Birth, aging, death, sorrow, complaining, pain, grief and despair cause dissatisfaction; closeness to what you don't like, separation from what you like and not getting what you want causes dissatisfaction. 

The origin of dissatisfaction is the desire that accumulates â€” accompanied by passion & delight craving for sensual pleasure, arising and non-becoming.
(SN 56.11)
