# The Buddha Speaks English
(1) This is the Noble Truth about dissatisfaction: Birth, aging, death, sorrow, complaining, pain, grief and despair are dissatisfaction; closeness to what you don't like is dissatisfaction; separation from what you like is dissatisfaction; not getting what you want is dissatisfaction. (SN 56.11)
