# The Buddha Speaks English
(1) This is the Noble Truth about dissatisfaction: Birth, aging, death, sorrow, complaining, pain, grief and despair are dissatisfaction; closeness to what you don't like is dissatisfaction; separation from what you like is dissatisfaction; not getting what you want is dissatisfaction. 

This is the noble truth of the origin of dissatisfaction: the craving that makes for further becoming — accompanied by passion & delight, relishing now here & now there — i.e., craving for sensual pleasure, craving for becoming, craving for non-becoming.
(SN 56.11)
