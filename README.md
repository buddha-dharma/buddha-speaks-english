# The Buddha Speaks English
(1) Birth, aging, death, sorrow, complaining, pain, grief and despair cause dissatisfaction; closeness to what you don't like causes dissatisfaction; separation from what you like causes dissatisfaction; not getting what you want causes dissatisfaction. 

The origin of dissatisfaction is the craving that makes for further arising — accompanied by passion & delight, relishing now here & now there — i.e., craving for sensual pleasure, craving for arising, craving for non-becoming.
(SN 56.11)
