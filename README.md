# The Buddha Speaks English
(1) "Now this is the Noble Truth of dissatisfaction: Birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, & despair are dissatisfaction; association with the unbeloved is dissatisfaction; separation from the loved is dissatisfaction; not getting what is wanted is dissatisfaction. In short, the five clinging-aggregates are dissatisfaction."

â€” SN 56.11
